The whole back end of the Adalo app

## setup
You need go. It's a go app.

I'm not using anything crazy so `go get` should work just fine.

To run, run `go run main.go`. In order for it to be usable you will need environment variable configurations. These come from a `.env` file in the root directory. Reach out to riley to get that.
